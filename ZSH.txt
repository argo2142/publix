had to manually install (from the software manager):
powerline fonts
Installed 2 items:
apt install zsh-theme-powerlevel9k
apt install fonts-powerline

I skipped step 5 and 6

Once dont - i went to the preferences of the terminal > went to the profile section and selected "x-term" as a color scheme

Sodenote:
I installed "embellish" (search for 'font' in software manager)
I liked LILEX for a font... only works for system fonts...not terminal... but it looks good
